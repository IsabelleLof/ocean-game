Hi everyone!

This is my first attempt to change or modify a three.js - project!

My work-in-progress features:

- Get a day and night mode, with a sun that goes up and down.
- Change so the user can "drive" the boat in a "user mode".
- Have a controll panel.

A summary from Chat-gpt about to code:

"This code sets up a 3D scene using the Three.js library, featuring a water surface, a skybox, and a boat model that moves based on keyboard input. Here's a breakdown:

Imports: The code imports necessary modules from Three.js, including rendering, controls, water, sky, and a GLTF loader for 3D models.
Boat Class: Defines a Boat class that loads a boat model (scene.gltf), positions it, and provides methods to control its movement.
Initialization: Sets up the Three.js scene, including the renderer, camera, water, sky, and controls. It also sets up event listeners for window resize and keyboard input to control the boat's movement.
Update Functions: Defines functions for updating the scene, including updating the position of the boat and the water animation.
Rendering Loop: Starts the rendering loop (animate function), which continuously updates and renders the scene.
Overall, this code creates a visually appealing 3D scene with interactive elements, demonstrating basic usage of Three.js for creating 3D graphics in a web environment."
